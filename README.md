# 🎮 Number Guessing Game (C++)

A simple console-based Number Guessing Game built using C++.

This project was created to practice basic C++ concepts like:
- Variables
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Random number generation
- User input handling

---

## 📌 How the Game Works

- The computer generates a random number within a specific range.
- The player tries to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program tells whether:
  - 📉 The guess is too low
  - 📈 The guess is too high
  - ✅ The guess is correct
- The game tracks the number of attempts.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Library (`iostream`, `cstdlib`, `ctime`)
- Compiled using MinGW / g++

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

###  Compile the Program

```bash
g++ game.cpp -o ouput
